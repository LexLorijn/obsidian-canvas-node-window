# Canvas Node Window
Automatically opens Canvas file nodes in a dedicated pop-out tab for seamless side-by-side editing. Perfect for users who love working with Canvas but prefer editing nodes in a clean, dedicated window rather than within the Canvas itself.

## Why use this plugin
When working with Canvas in Obsidian, this plugin automatically opens the selected file node in a pop-out tab. This allows you to:
- **Edit notes while viewing your Canvas** - Keep your Canvas visible on one screen while editing the selected note in another window.
- **Focus on content** - Reduce context switching by having both your Canvas overview and detailed note content visible simultaneously.
- **Streamline workflow** - Click any file node on your Canvas and instantly see it in a dedicated editing window, no need to manually open notes in a new window.

### Features
* Auto-Open Nodes: Clicking a file node (note) in the Canvas automatically opens it in a dedicated side window.
* Persistent Window: The plugin tracks a specific window/tab (marked with a "Workflow" icon). You can move this tab anywhere (e.g., pop it out to a second monitor), and the plugin will keep updating it.
* Optimized Performance: Only triggers when interacting with Canvas nodes.

## How to use
1. Open any Canvas file in Obsidian
2. Click on a file node (a note linked in your Canvas)
3. The plugin automatically opens that file in a pop-out window
4. Click different file nodes to switch what's displayed in the pop-out window
5. The pop-out window stays open and updates as you select different nodes
