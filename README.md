# Canvas Node Window

Automatically opens Canvas file nodes in a dedicated pop-out window for seamless side-by-side editing.

## What it does

When working with Canvas in Obsidian, this plugin automatically opens the selected file node in a separate pop-out window. This allows you to:

- **Edit notes while viewing your Canvas** - Keep your Canvas visible on one screen while editing the selected note in another window.
- **Focus on content** - Reduce context switching by having both your Canvas overview and detailed note content visible simultaneously.
- **Streamline workflow** - Click any file node on your Canvas and instantly see it in a dedicated editing window, no need to manually open notes in a new window.

Perfect for users who love working with Canvas but prefer editing nodes in a clean, dedicated window rather than within the Canvas itself.

## How to use

1. Open any Canvas file in Obsidian
2. Click on a file node (a note linked in your Canvas)
3. The plugin automatically opens that file in a pop-out window
4. Click different file nodes to switch what's displayed in the pop-out window
5. The pop-out window stays open and updates as you select different nodes

### Toggle the plugin on/off

To bind a keybind; open the Command Palette (`Ctrl/Cmd + P`) and search for:
- **"Toggle Canvas Focus Window"** - Enable or disable the plugin

When disabled, the pop-out window closes and the plugin stops monitoring your Canvas.
